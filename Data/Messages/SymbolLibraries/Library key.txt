The symbol library has 2 directories; us and et
The 'us' directory has the amino acid image files using the 22 amino acids we are familiar with
The 'et' directory has the amino acid image files using the 5 amino acids that were sent in the message.

The insertion handle for all images is 6,12.  This is zero based.  This is position of the upper left nitrogen symbol in the image.

Filename format
a b.ttt

a	symbol name, one of more characters
b	'us' for our symbols, 'et' for ET's symbols

ttt	File extension or type
	bmp bitmap file
	raw raw image file
	Note:  This only indicates file format  If there are 2 or more files
	with the same name but different extensions thay should form identical images

a b	symbol name plus the set designator (ours or ET's) represent different amino acids

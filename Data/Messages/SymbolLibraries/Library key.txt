The symbol library has 2 directories; us and et
The 'us' directory has the amino acid image files using the 22 amino acids we are familiar with
The 'et' directory has the amino acid image files using the 5 amino acids that were sent in the message.

Filename format
a b.ttt

a	symbol name, one of more characters
b	'us' for our symbols, 'et' for ET's symbols

ttt	File extension or type
	bmp bitmap file
	raw raw image file
	Note:  This only indicates file format  If there are 2 or more files
	with the same name but different extensions thay should form identical images

a b	symbol name plus the set designator (ours or ET's) represent different amino acids

The rules for drawing a amino acid in the ASIS format:

Atom rules:
1.) The number of pixel in a block represents the atomic number for the atom.
2.) The block can not be more than 3 pixels wide.
3.) An incomplete row is always at the bottom of the block.
4.) An incomplete row is always left justified.

Bond Rules:
1. Bond require 3 connected pixels and only 3.  This does cover all the diagonal, horizontal, vertical and caret bonds.
2. Double bond has 2 of the three pixel bonds in parallel.
3. The gap between the connection molecules can only be one pixel.
4. A caret bond can have a 2 pixel gap to the connecting atom but only on one side.
